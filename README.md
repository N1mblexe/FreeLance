I have been working as a freelancer for almost 2 years, contributing to various projects during this time.
Whenever possible, I make an effort to share the projects I have worked on, with permission from the clients Iâ€™ve collaborated with. 
However, due to confidentiality agreements or other reasons, some projects cannot be shared publicly. Therefore, the projects you see here are the ones I have permission to showcase.

This repo mostly contains Java , C# , C++ , C and a little bit of python
